# CyberAntifraud — PhD Showcase

This repository powers the public website **cyberantifraud.com** (or GitHub Pages fallback). It presents projects, publications, team, governance and impact of a PhD focused on **fraud detection in merchant acquiring** using **Deep Learning** and **LLM‑based attack simulation**.

## Structure
- `index.html` — single‑page site (no build needed)
- `assets/` — icons and social image

## Local preview
Open `index.html` in your browser, or run a tiny server:
```bash
python3 -m http.server 8080
```

## Deploy to GitHub Pages
1. Create a repo and push these files to the default branch.
2. In *Settings → Pages*, set “Deploy from a branch” and select the default branch root.
3. (Optional) Add a `CNAME` file with `cyberantifraud.com` if you have a custom domain.

## Customise
- Replace placeholders like `[tbd]`, `[DOI]`, `[GitHub link]`.
- Put your real logos in `assets/` keeping the same filenames or update the `<img>` src paths.
